### Permissions and chmod
$

As with "all" Linux related questions, get help from the help option (-h --h -help --help) or the manual: 
```Linux
chmod --help
man chmod
```

d|rwx|r-x|r-x > directory|your permissions|group permission|users permission

(r) read
(w) write
(x) execute

Only the own can change permissions. 

If you create a new folder only you will be able to write (change) anything in the folder or the folder itself
