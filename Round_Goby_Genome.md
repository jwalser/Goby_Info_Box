Note:
***N50*** statistic defines assembly quality. Given a set of contigs, each with its own length, the N50 length is defined as the shortest sequence length at 50% of the genome. !!! When comparing N50 values from different assemblies, the assembly sizes must be the same size in order for N50 to be meaningful !!!
